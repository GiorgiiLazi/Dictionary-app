The following dictionary app is an open-source project made by Lazishvili Giorgi
This app allows to get multiple definitions (verbs and nouns) of english words and word's transcription by using external API. 
I used Free Dictionary API (https://dictionaryapi.dev/) to create the project.


For project layout purposes I used css grid columns and rows.
This project applies dark/light theme variations and font type switcher for better user experience which was made possible by DOM manipulations through event listeners such as "click" and "change".
The interactive part of dictionary app was written in TypeScript and compiled back to Javascript.
I applied classes for async functions in order to save time and space.
I would be the most happy to see your feedback!

Sincerely yours,
Lazishvili Giorgi
